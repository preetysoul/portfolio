    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a BCA student with hands-on experience at a media company, where I had a good grasp of content creation, social media strategy, and audience engagement. With a combination of technical skills and creative talents, I am interested in digital marketing and eager to apply my skills in an exciting internship role. I'm a quick learner, adaptable, and eager to work on innovative marketing campaigns and grow professionally.</p>
